string\_da99
===========

My helper functions for strings. 


Install & Use
============

In your shell:

    npm install string_da99


In your CoffeeScript:

    str = require 'string_da99'


    my_str = "Shutdown the govt schools."

    str(my_str).whitespace_split()

    # --->

    [ "Shutdown", "the", "govt", "schools." ]


There's more...
===============

I'm not going to write more since I prefer most people
not to use my code.
